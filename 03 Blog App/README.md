## ðŸ§  Summary

I learned how to build the backend for a simple blog application using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This includes creating and organizing multiple models (Post, Comment, Like), writing controllers for CRUD-like operations, setting up routes, and testing everything using Postman and MongoDB Compass.
